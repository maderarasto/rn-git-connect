# Git Connect (react native app)
This project is mobile cross-platform application developed using **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** library and **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** language. The application serves as **[git](https://git-scm.com/)** client for managing remote repositories directly from your phone.

## Motivation
An idea for this project was to easily maintain project repositories and also used react (native) and typescript skills on a real project.

## What I have learned
- Context API
- React/Tan Query hooks such as useQuery, useInfiniteQuery and useMutation
- Handling forms using React Form hooks
- React Native animations
